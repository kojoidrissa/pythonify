#Pythonify

This is a project to help me take various data sources (starting with spreadsheets) and quickly turn them into Python constructs.

I'll often run into a situation where I'll think, "If I could get at this in Python instead of Excel, I'd have much better options."  So, now I'm going to start writing some simple code to help make that happen.

Step 1: turn a spreadsheet with a header row into a nested list, with each internal list representing a row. I should probably do this as tuples as well.
